# SugjarJar

Welcome to SugarJar - a git/github helper. It leverages the amazing GitHub cli,
[hub](https://hub.github.com/), so you'll need that installed.

SugarJar is inspired by [arcanist](https://github.com/phacility/arcanist), and
it's replacement at Facebook, JellyFish. Many of the features they provide for
the Phabricator workflow this aims to bring to the GitHub workflow.

In particular there are a lot of helpers for using a squash-merge workflow that
is poorly handled by the standard toolsets.

## Commands

### amend

Amend the current commit. Alias for "git commit --amend".  Accepts other
arguments such as "-a" or files.

### amendq, qamend

Same as "amend" but without changing the message. Alias for "git commit --amend
--no-edit".

### bclean

If safe, delete the current branch. Unlike "git branch -d", bclean can handle
squash-merged branches. Think of it as a smarter "git branch -d".

### bcleanall

Walk all branches, and try to delete them if it's safe. See "bclean" for
details.

### binfo

Verbose information about the current branch.

### br

Verbose branch list. An alias for "git branch -v".

### feature

Create a "feature" branch. It's morally equivalent to "git checkout -b" except
it defaults to creating it based on some form of 'master' instead of your
current branch. In order of preference it will be upstream/master,
origin/master, master, depending upon what remotes are available.

### forcepush, fpush

The same as "smartpush", but uses "--force-with-lease". This is a "safer" way
of doing force-pushes and is the recommended way to push after rebasing or
amending. Never do this to shared branches. Very convenient for keeping the
branch behind a pull- request clean.

### lint

Run any linters configured in .sugarjar.yaml.

### smartclone, sclone

A smart wrapper to "git clone" that handles forking and managing remotes for
you.  It will clone a git repository using hub-style short name ("$org/$repo").
If the org of the repository is not the same as your github-user then it will
fork the repo for you to your account (if not already done) and then setup your
remotes so that "origin" is your fork and "upstream" is the upstream.

### smartpush, spush

A smart wrapper to "git push" that runs whatever is defined in "on_push" in
.sugarjar.yml, and only pushes if they succeed.

### unit

Run any unitests configured in .sugarjar.yaml.

# up

Rebase the current branch on upstream/master or origin/master.

# upall

Same as "up", but for all branches.

## User Configuration

Sugarjar will read in both a system-level config file
(`/etc/sugarjar/config.yaml`) and a user-level config file
`~/.config/sugarjar/config.yaml`, if they exist. Anything in the user config
will override the system config, and command-line options override both. The
yaml file is a straight key-value pair of options without their '--'. For
example:

```yaml
debug: true
github-user: jaymzh
```

In addition, the environment variable `SUGARJAR_DEBUG` can be defined to set
debug on. This is primarily used as a way to turn debug on earlier in order to
troubleshoot configuration parsing.

## Repository Configuration

Sugarjar looks for a ".sugarjar.yaml" in the root of the repository to tell it
how to handle repo-specific things. Currently there are only three
configurations accepted:

* lint - A list of scripts to run on `sj lint`. These should be linters like
  rubocop or pyflake.
* unit - A list of scripts to run on `sj unit`. These should be unittest
  runners like rspec or pyunit.
* on_push - A list of types (`lint", `unit`) of checks to run before pushing.
  It is highly recommended this is only `lint`. The goal here is to allow for
  the user to get quick stylistic feedback before pushing their branch to avoid
  the push-fix-push-fix loop.

Example configuration:

```yaml
lint:
  - scripts/lint
unit:
  - scripts/unit
on_push:
  - lint
```

## FAQ

Why the name SugarJar?

It's mostly a backranym. Like jellyfish, I wanted two letters that were on
home row on different sides of the keyboard to make it easy to type. I looked
at the possible options that where there and not taken and tried to find one
I could make an appropriate name out of. Since this utility adds lots of sugar
to git and github, it seemed appropriate.

Why did you use `hub` instead of the newer `gh` CLI?

`gh` is less feature-rich (currently). I'm also considering making this optionally
act as a wrapper to `hub` the way `hub` can be a wrapper to `git`.
