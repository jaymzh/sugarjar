COMMANDS:
  amend
              Amend the current commit. Alias for "git commit --amend".
              Accepts other arguments such as "-a" or files.

  amendq, qamend
              Same as "amend" but without changing the message. Alias for
              "git commit --amend --no-edit".

  binfo
              Verbose information about the current branch.

  br
              Verbose branch list. An alias for "git branch -v".

  debuginfo
              Prints out a bunch of version and config information useful for
              including in bug reports.

  feature, f <branch_name>
              Create a "feature" branch. It's morally equivalent to
              "git checkout -b" except it defaults to creating it based on
              some form of 'master' instead of your current branch. In order
              of preference it will be upstream/master, origin/master, master,
              depending upon what remotes are available.

              Note that you can specify "--feature-prefix" (or add
              "feature_prefix" to your config) to have all features created
              with a prefix. This is useful for branch-based workflows where
              developers are expected to create branches names that, for
              example, start with their username.

  forcepush, fpush
              The same as "smartpush", but uses "--force-with-lease". This is
              a "safer" way of doing force-pushes and is the recommended way
              to push after rebasing or amending. Never do this to shared
              branches. Very convenient for keeping the branch behind a pull-
              request clean.

  globalbranchclean, gbclean [<branch>] [<remote>]
              WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL COMMAND.

              Combination of "lbclean" and "rbclean". Cleans up
              both local and remote branches safely. See those commands for
              details.

  globalbranchcleanall, gbcleanall [<remote>]
              WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL COMMAND.

              Safely clean all branches, both local and remote.  See "gbclean"
              for details.

  lint
              Run any linters configured in .sugarjar.yaml.

  localbranchclean, lbclean [<branch>]
              If safe, delete the current branch (or the specified branch).
              Unlike "git branch -d", lbclean can handle squash-merged branches.
              Think of it as a smarter "git branch -d".

              Aliased to 'bclean' for backwards compatibility.

  localbranchcleanall, lbcleanall
              Walk all branches, and try to delete them if it's safe. See
              "lbclean" for details.

              Aliased to 'bcleanall' for backwards compatibility.

  pullsuggestions, ps
              Pull any suggestions *that have been committed* in the GitHub UI.
              This will show the diff and prompt for confirmation before
              merging. Note that a fast-forward merge will be used.

  remotebranchclean, rbclean [<branch>] [<remote>]
              WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL COMMAND.

              Similar to lbclean, except safely cleans up remote branches.
              Unlike many git commands, <remote> comes after <branch> so
              that you can specify a branch and the remote defaults to 'origin'.
              This means you can do "sj rclean" to clean the remote branch with
              the same name as the local one. Note that you probably want
              "sclean", which will do both local and remote cleaning in one
              command.

              WARNING: This command cannot differentiate release branches
              that are fully merged but still need to be kept around for future
              work. So if main contains everything that 2.0-devel and 3.0-devel
              has, then those branches will be deleted. Use with caution.

  remotebranchcleanall, rbcleanall [<remote>]
              WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL COMMAND.

              Walk all remote branches, and try to delete them if it's safe. See
              "rbclean" for details.

  smartclone, sclone
              A smart wrapper to "git clone" that handles forking and managing
              remotes for you.
              It will clone a git repository using hub-style short name
              ("$org/$repo"). If the org of the repository is not the same
              as your github-user then it will fork the repo for you to
              your account (if not already done) and then setup your remotes
              so that "origin" is your fork and "upstream" is the upstream.

  smartlog, sl
              Inspired by Facebook's "sl" extension to Mercurial, this command
              will show you a tree of all your local branches relative to your
              upstream.

  smartpullrequest, smartpr, spr
              A smart wrapper to "hub pull-request" that checks if your repo
              is dirty before creating the pull request.

  smartpush, spush
              A smart wrapper to "git push" that runs whatever is defined in
              "on_push" in .sugarjar.yml, and only pushes if they succeed.

  subfeature, sf <feature>
              An alias for 'sj feature <feature> <current_branch>'

  sync
              Similar to `up`, except instead of rebasing on a tracked branch
              (usually `upstream` remote), rebases to wherever our remote push
              target is (usually `origin` remote). Useful for syncing work
              across different machines.

              For example, if you do some work on feature `foo` on machine1 and
              push to `origin/foo` (intending to eventually merge to
              `upstream/foo`), then on machine2, you pull that branch, do more
              work, which you also push to `origin/foo`, then on machine1, you
              can do `sj sync` to pull down the changes from `origin/foo`. If
              you have local changes, that are not already on `origin/foo`,
              those will be rebased on top of the changes from `origin/foo`.

  unit
              Run any unitests configured in .sugarjar.yaml.

  up [<branch>]
              Rebase the current branch (or specified branch) intelligently.
              In most causes this will check for a main (or master) branch on
              upstream, then origin. If a branch explicitly tracks something
              else, then that will be used, instead.

  upall
              Same as "up", but for all branches.
