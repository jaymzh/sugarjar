COMMANDS:
  amend
              Amend the current commit. Alias for "git commit --amend".
              Accepts other arguments such as "-a" or files.

  amendq, qamend
              Same as "amend" but without changing the message. Alias for
              "git commit --amend --no-edit".

  bclean
              If safe, delete the current branch. Unlike "git branch -d",
              bclean can handle squash-merged branches. Think of it as
              a smarter "git branch -d".

  bcleanall
              Walk all branches, and try to delete them if it's safe. See
              "bclean" for details.

  binfo
              Verbose information about the current branch.

  br
              Verbose branch list. An alias for "git branch -v".

  feature
              Create a "feature" branch. It's morally equivalent to
              "git checkout -b" except it defaults to creating it based on
              some form of 'master' instead of your current branch. In order
              of preference it will be upstream/master, origin/master, master,
              depending upon what remotes are available.

  forcepush, fpush
              The same as "smartpush", but uses "--force-with-lease". This is
              a "safer" way of doing force-pushes and is the recommended way
              to push after rebasing or amending. Never do this to shared
              branches. Very convenient for keeping the branch behind a pull-
              request clean.

  lint
              Run any linters configured in .sugarjar.yaml.

  smartclone, sclone
              A smart wrapper to "git clone" that handles forking and managing
              remotes for you.
              It will clone a git repository using hub-style short name
              ("$org/$repo"). If the org of the repository is not the same
              as your github-user then it will fork the repo for you to
              your account (if not already done) and then setup your remotes
              so that "origin" is your fork and "upstream" is the upstream.

  smartpush, spush
              A smart wrapper to "git push" that runs whatever is defined in
              "on_push" in .sugarjar.yml, and only pushes if they succeed.

  unit
              Run any unitests configured in .sugarjar.yaml.

  up
              Rebase the current branch on upstream/master or origin/master.

  upall
              Same as "up", but for all branches.
COMMANDS

  opts.separator <<CONFIG

USER CONFIGURATION:
Sugarjar will read in both a system-level config file
(/etc/sugarjar/config.yaml) and a user-level config file ~/config.yaml, if they
exist. Anything in the user config will override the system config, and command-
line options override both. The yaml file is a straight key-value pair of
options without their '--'. For example:

    debug: true
    github-user: jaymzh

In addition, the environment variable SUGARJAR_DEBUG can be defined to set
debug on. This is primarily used as a way to turn debug on earlier in order to
troubleshoot configuration parsing.
CONFIG

  opts.separator <<REPO_CONFIG

REPOSITORY CONFIGURATION:
Sugarjar looks for a ".sugarjar.yaml" in the root of the repository to tell it
how to handle repo-specific things. Currently there are only three
configurations accepted:

  lint
              A list of scripts to run on "sj lint". These should be linters
              like rubocop or pyflake.

  unit
              A list of scripts to run on "sj unit". These should be unittest
              runners like rspec or pyunit.

  on_push
              A list of types ("lint", "unit") of checks to run before pushing.
              It is highly recommended this is only "lint". The goal here is
              to allow for the user to get quick stylistic feedback before
              pushing their branch to avoid the push-fix-push-fix loop.

Example configuration:

    lint:
      - scripts/lint
    unit:
      - scripts/unit
    on_push:
      - lint

extra_opts += ARGV

  puts parser
  exit
